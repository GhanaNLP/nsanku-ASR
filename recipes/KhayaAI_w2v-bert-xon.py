"""Evaluation recipe for KhayaAI/w2v-bert-xon.

Architecture: CTC (AutoModelForCTC)
Precision: fp32 (wav2vec2/xls-r/MMS conv encoders crash in bf16 on Hopper)
Benchmarked languages: xon
Status: passed - best avg WER 45.86% (avg WER+CER 35.40%)

Edit this file and open a pull request at
https://github.com/GhanaNLP/nsanku-ASR to change how this model is evaluated on the next
benchmark run. `build_wrapper(device)` is what the benchmark calls.
